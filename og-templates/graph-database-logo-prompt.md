# Graph Database Logo Generation Prompt

## AI Image Generation Prompt for Graph Database Product Icon

```
Create a modern, professional icon for a graph database product with the following specifications:

**Style Requirements:**
- Minimalist, geometric design suitable for technology branding
- Vector-style appearance with clean lines and shapes
- Professional B2B software aesthetic (similar to MongoDB, Neo4j, or AWS service icons)
- Suitable for use at various sizes (scalable design)

**Visual Elements:**
- Primary concept: Graph database/network visualization
- Show interconnected nodes and edges/relationships
- 3-6 circular nodes connected by clean lines
- Nodes should vary slightly in size to show hierarchy/importance
- Connections should be clean, geometric lines (not organic curves)

**Color Scheme:**
- Primary: Teal (#1E9E95) - main brand color
- Secondary: Deep blue (#2D4263) - accent color
- Optional: White highlights for contrast

**Technical Specifications:**
- Square format (1:1 aspect ratio)
- High contrast for visibility
- Clean background (transparent or solid color)
- Crisp edges suitable for digital use
- Icon should work on both light and dark backgrounds

**Design Approach:**
- Think "database meets network topology"
- Modern tech company icon style
- Avoid overly complex details
- Focus on recognizable database/graph concepts
- Should convey "connectivity", "relationships", "data structure"

**Examples of Good Style:**
- Material Design icons
- Feather icons
- Heroicons
- Clean, geometric interpretation of network diagrams

**Avoid:**
- Organic, hand-drawn styles
- Overly complex network diagrams
- Cartoon-like appearances
- Too many small details that won't scale well
- Generic database cylinder icons

The icon should immediately convey "graph database" to a technical audience while maintaining the professional, modern aesthetic of the Konnektr brand.
